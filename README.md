# Code Quiz

I have created a page with a basic quiz format, allowing users to answer questions and save their scores. Devs can add or change questions and modify the scoring system.

This application uses JavaScript. Upon clicking the Begin button, the user should be presented a question, a list of possible answers, and a timer.

When the correct answer is selected, the page should reaffirm the user and move them on to the next question.

If an incorrect answer is input, time is subtracted and the user's score goes down.

At the end of the quiz, the user has the option to input their initials and save their high score to local storage. They can also clear the high score list if they wish.

Check the directory folder for a demonstration video of how the program works.

## Deployment
